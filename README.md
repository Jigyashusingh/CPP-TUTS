#Description

This repository contains a C++ code snippet that demonstrates various operations using vectors and pairs, along with basic input/output operations.

Setup

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
Create a new C++ source file and copy the provided code into it.
Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
Usage

The program initializes a vector v with four elements, all set to 20.
It then creates a copy of the vector v named v2.
Next, the program demonstrates adding elements to the vector v and printing its size and contents.
It also showcases the usage of vectors of pairs (vector<pair<int,int>>) and calculates the sum of elements in an array.
Code Explanation

The code utilizes vectors (std::vector) for dynamic arrays and pairs (std::pair) for storing pairs of integers.
It demonstrates various vector operations such as initialization, copying, pushing back elements, and iterating through elements.
Basic input/output operations (std::cin and std::cout) are used for user input and displaying results.
